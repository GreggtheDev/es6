// Step 1: Create two arrays of numbers called numbers1 and numbers2
const numbers1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const numbers2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

// Step 2: Use the spread operator to create an array called numbers that combines the elements of numbers1 and numbers2
const numbers = [...numbers1, ...numbers2];
